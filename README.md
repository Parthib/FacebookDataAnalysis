# FacebookDataAnalysis
A python script that parses through Facebook Messenger messages and makes frequency tables

Using this script requires you to download your Messenger messages from Facebook and run the script from that directory. Change the name of interest as a parameter to the "runGramAnalysis" function. If you would rather generate a CSV for use with Flourish, uncomment the runGenerateCSV function.
